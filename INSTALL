Thanks for downloading django-feedstorage.

Installation
============

* Install dependencies
The ``requests`` and ``lxml`` modules are required.

For now, it has just been tested with: Python 2.7, Django 1.4, requests 0.13.2 and lxml 2.3.4
but feel free to try it with other versions and let me know.

You can use the :file:`requirements.txt` file with pip::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
* Install django-feedstorage::

Run the following command inside this directory::

    python setup.py install

Or install from PyPI with ``pip``::

    pip install django-feedstorage

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``feedstorage``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Mercurial checkout.

* Add ``feedstorage`` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting
Update the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting of your Django project::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'feedstorage',
    )

* Sync the DB:

If you are using South, run the migrations::

    ./manage.py migrate feedstorage

Otherwise, run ``syncdb``::

    ./manage.py syncdb
    
.. admonition:: 

    Note that for now, this application has just been tested with Python 2.7 and a 
    functional installation of Django 1.4. You can obtain Python
    from http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
