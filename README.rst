==================
django-feedstorage
==================

This is an application designed for storing Feeds entries 
and notifying subscribers only when there are new entries.

It has 2 dependencies: ``requests`` and ``lxml``.

For now, it has just been tested with: Python 2.7, Django 1.4, requests 0.13.2 and lxml 2.3.4
but feel free to try it with other versions and let me know.

For installation instructions, see the file ``INSTALL.rst`` in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file ``overview.rst`` in the ``docs/``
directory.

  
  
Next things to do
-----------------

See the roadmap on Trello: https://trello.com/b/zPAnRZsL

* write tests cases
* write more documentation
* test with older versions of python and django
* add Scheduling in the admin
* handle more feed formats
* notify new entries in a merged XML file instead of several Entry objects
* refactoring: create a "callback" custom field to serialize/deserialize a callable object
